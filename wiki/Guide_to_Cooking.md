# Guide to Cooking

## Why cook?

Cooking is useful for making meat and water safe to consume, as well as
increasing the nutrition value of every other non-meat food, like
vegetables and wheat-derived products.

Furthermore, more complex recipes are also even more nutritious and improve **[mood](Starter_Guide#mood "wikilink")**. Besides, this also presents interesting RP options, such as being vegetarian, perhaps pork-free, et cetera, some of which could be enforced with selectable **[traits](Guide_to_Character#traits)**.

<td><b>Knife</b></td>
<td>Made with either 4 bone pieces or 1 unit of manifold materials: stone, copper, bronze, iron, steel, tin, even gold, silver and diamonds. A versatile tool that is used to cut various foods.

<td><b>Hammer</b></td>
<td>Made with 5 wood logs or 3 iron ingots (clawhammer, the bottom one, a modern and quicker variant of the hammer). Beat the crap out of food to rid it of any contaminants (at least sizeable ones)! Required in some culinary processes. Same as knife, has use in other areas - <b><a href="Guide_to_Crafting#tools">Guide to Crafting</a></b>.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="assets/images/cutting_board.png"></td>
<td><b>Cutting board</b></td>
<td>Made with 5 wood. Used to form meat and mince it before the invention of the meat grinder. Place <b>meat steaks</b> and <b>fish</b>, then mince them with a knife. Place <b>mince</b> on the board and use knife again to make <b>meatballs</b>, which you can then press into <b>patties</b>.</td>

<td><img src="assets/images/meat_grinder.png"></td>
<td><b>Meat grinder</b></td>
<td>Made with 8 iron. Used to mince fish and various meats. More efficient than the cutting board. The minceable items: <b>steaks</b>, <b>cutlets</b>, <b>fish</b>, <b>ham leg</b>, <b>chicken (carcass, thigh, wing, breast)</b>.</td>

The advantage of stew is that you get rid of thirst and hunger at the same time, as long as you don't cook it with salty water or dried meat, as those contain salt and will dehydrate you. Another benefit is the fact that the contents of this fascinating cooking pot will never go stale or decompose, allowing you to store food indefinitely! <b>Filled wooden bowls will go bad (disappear) if not eaten</b>.</td>

## Food storage

~~Store in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.~~

Most foods will spoil and decay (read, vanish from existence) if left in the open. Some preserved, as well as canned food are an exception and will last as long the world does (until the end of the round). Scattered food may also attract pests, such as mice.

Finding a formerly bursting-at-the-seams pantry devoid of its delicious contents may very well reduce a hungry soul to tears. Fortunately, there are ways to extend the shelf life of your food stock, which boil down to storing food inside any crate or a fridge.

Check **[here](Food_Decay_Times "wikilink")** for the decay times for different **unstored** foods.

**Meat and fish products also rot! It takes half the time of full decay!** Meaning, it takes a meat slab 15 minutes to decay, but it will become rotten after 7.5 minutes.

Decay time for the food stored in a **crate** is **doubled**.

Decay time for the food stored in a **fridge** is **tripled**. **A fridge must be [connected](Guide_to_Crafting#wiring "wikilink") to a [power source](Guide_to_Crafting#engines "wikilink") to work!**

## Campfire, Oven and Wood Stove

Campfires and ovens can be used to roast food and prepare advanced
recipes, as well as to boil water for safe consumption and burn down
any uncookable item into a burned mess (disappears after a while).

You can roast plenty of things: vegetables, meat, fish etc.

  - Make a campfire with wood, an oven with iron, or a wood stove with
    steel. A campfire can cook two items at a time, whereas an oven can
    cook three at a time, and the best being the wood stove which can
    cook four items at a time which is the best way to save fuel. Oven and stove also cook much faster.
  - Put some fuel inside (wood or coal, for instance).
  - Place food or container filled with water to boil.
  - Wait for it to finish cooking/boiling.
  - Eat!

A more detailed section on campfires and ovens could be found **[here](Guide_to_Crafting#campfire-iron-oven-and-wood-stove "wikilink")**.

## Ingredients

All great dishes require ingredients! Here you will find the
ingredients needed to make your fantastic dishes, uma delicia!
