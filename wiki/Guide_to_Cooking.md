# Guide to Cooking

## Why cook?

Cooking is useful for making meat and water safe to consume, as well as
increasing the nutrition value of every other non-meat food, like
vegetables and wheat-derived products.

Furthermore, more complex recipes are also even more nutritious and improve **[mood](Starter_Guide#mood "wikilink")**. Besides, this also presents interesting RP options, such as being vegetarian, perhaps pork-free, et cetera, some of which could be enforced with selectable **[traits](Guide_to_Character#traits)**.

<td><b>Knife</b></td>
<td>Made with either 4 bone pieces or 1 unit of manifold materials: stone, copper, bronze, iron, steel, tin, even gold, silver and diamonds. A versatile tool that is used to cut various foods.

<td><img src="assets/images/cutting_board.png"></td>
<td><b>Cutting board</b></td>
<td>Made with 5 wood. Used to mince and form meat before the invention of the meat grinder. Place <b>meat steaks</b> and <b>fish</b>, then mince them with a knife. Place <b>mince</b> on the board and use knife again to make <b>meatballs</b>, which you can then press into <b>patties</b>.</td>

The advantage of stew is that you get rid of thirst and hunger at the same time, as long as you don't cook it with salty water or dried meat, as those contain salt and will dehydrate you. Another benefit is the fact that the contents of this fascinating cooking pot will never go stale or decompose, allowing you to store food indefinitely! <b>Filled wooden bowls will go bad (disappear) if not eaten</b>.</td>

## Food storage

~~Store in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.~~

Most foods will spoil and decay (read, vanish from existence) if left in the open. Some preserved, as well as canned food are an exception and will last as long the world does (until the end of the round).

Check **[here](Food_Decay_Times "wikilink")** for the decay times for different **unstored** foods.

**Meat and fish products also rot! It takes half the time of full decay!** Meaning, it takes a meat slab 15 minutes to decay, but it will become rotten after 7.5 minutes.

Finding a formerly bursting-at-the-seams pantry devoid of its delicious contents may very well reduce a hungry soul to tears. Fortunately, there are ways to extend the shelf life of your food stock, which boil down to storing food inside any crate or a fridge.

Decay time for the food stored in a **crate** is **doubled**.

Decay time for the food stored in a **fridge** is **tripled**. **A fridge must be [connected](Guide_to_Crafting#wiring "wikilink") to a [power source](Guide_to_Crafting#engines "wikilink") to work!**

## Campfire, Oven and Wood Stove

Campfires and ovens can be used to roast food and prepare advanced
recipes, as well as to boil water for safe consumption and burn down
any uncookable item into a burned mess (disappears after a while).

You can roast almost anything remotely edible and it will feed a hungry mouth, but this is hardly fine cuisine.

  - Make a campfire with wood, an oven with iron, or a wood stove with
    steel. A campfire can cook two items at a time, whereas an oven can
    cook three at a time, and the best being the wood stove which can
    cook four items at a time which is the best way to save fuel. Oven and stove also cook much faster.
  - Put some fuel inside (wood or coal, for instance).
  - Place food or container filled with water to boil.
  - Wait for it to finish cooking/boiling.
  - Eat!

A more detailed section on campfires and ovens could be found **[here](Guide_to_Crafting#campfire-iron-oven-and-wood-stove "wikilink")**.
