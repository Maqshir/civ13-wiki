# Guide to Fishing

Feeding a large population could be challenging, especially when there is a lack of arable land, wild game is nearing exctinction and ancestors ate all the poultry and livestock long ago. Despair not, though, for there remains a sizeable source of food to tap - seas and rivers, whose unsuspecting inhabitants are in for a big surprise.

Remember to check the **[Guide to Cooking](Guide_to_Cooking)** once you come home loaded with seafood.

## Fishing

* Equip yourself with one of the fishing tools.
* Head to a waterbody.
* Locate a tile teeming with fish.
* Click the tile with the fishing tool... again... and again.

Alternately, you can build a **fishing cage** in water for a more passive approach.

If you have fished out a tile completely and there is no more fish, come back later - clueless creatures should appear at the same spot.
